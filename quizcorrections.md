### Question 14:
An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences?

- My Answer: B
- Correct Answer: C
- Explanation of my Answer and Correct Answer: I thought the answer was B as I have thought that have an additional bit of sequence would mean an increase of the value of the base of 10.
Now I know that 7-bit sequence and 6-bit sequence would mean that the 7-bit would have double the times of the number of items can be idenitifed.

### Question 20:
Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

For example, if list1 contains
["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]
and list2 contains
["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"],
then newList will contain
["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].

- My Answer: B
- Correct Answer: A
- Explanation of my Answer and the Correct Answer: I thought that the answer is B as I believed that first combining the two lists would be easier for the palindormes to be found after then put in alphabetical order.
Though now I undestand that the answer is A as combining the list before sorting would use what we already have which are two terms to further find a final list.

### Question 26:
A certain social media Web site allows users to post messages and to comment on other messages that have been posted. When a user posts a message, the message itself is considered data. In addition to the data, the site stores the following metadata.

The time the message was posted

The name of the user who posted the message

The names of any users who comment on the message and the times the comments were made

For which of the following goals would it be more useful to analyze the data instead of the metadata?

- My Answer: A
- Correct Answer: C
- Explanation of my Answer and the Correct Answer: I thought that the answer is A as I thought that the topic of how frequent a user posts would give the data because of the quantity of messages. However, now I know that anytime that realtes time, data, and 
geographic locations is all metadata.

### Question 28:
Which of the following is a true statement about data compression?

- My Answer: A
- Correct Answer: D
- Explanation of my Answer and Correct Answer: I thought that the answer was A because data compression is mostly done through networking in the internet. Though, data compression consists of non-network
situations such as saving compressed files on my computer.

### Question 34:
Which of the following best explains how the Internet is a fault-tolerant system?

- My Answer: C
- Correct Answer: B
- Explanation of my Answer and Correct Answer: I thought that the answer was C bc/ when I thought of "different manaufacutres" I realted to the fact in fault-tolerant system there can be 
multiple devices that can be used, however I had gotten confused in the wording of the question. The corrected answer is vaild bc/ fault-tolernant system is made to work even with a few failures of some devices.

### Question 37:
The following code segment is intended to set max equal to the maximum value among the integer variables x, y, and z. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases.
Which of the following initial values for x, y, and z can be used to show that the code segment does not work as intended?

- My Answer: B
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both Answers: I thought that the answer was B bc/ when I tried out the given values and the code I saw that x and z would make the code to not work. However, with the answer on D all three values make the code segment not to work based on what is intended.

### Question 40:
A city government is attempting to reduce the digital divide between groups with differing access to computing and the Internet. Which of the following activities is LEAST likely to be effective in this purpose?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was A bc/ taking computer classes wouldn't necessarily mean that everyone would have multiple computers or unlimited access to networking outside of their classes. However, it is more likley that digital divide
would occur when all government forms are put on the website bc/ of the necessary resources being on a medium that doesn't guarantee that everyone would have access to.

### Question 41:
The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two computers that are not directly connected must go through at least one other computer. For example, information can be sent directly between computers A and B, but information sent between computers A and C must go through other computers.
What is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed in the network before computer E can no longer communicate with computer F?

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was D bc/ I had assumed that the question was asking the amount of connection needed for E to be connected with F. Therefore, I had made a silly mistake of not reading the question correctly
and therefore choosing an answer that the question didn't ask.

### Question 44:
Which of the following is LEAST likely to indicate a phishing attack?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was B bc/ I have never heard of someone calling the number on their cards to verify the transcation, therefore I wasn't aware that this is not a phising attack. The answer B is correct because it
is shady for someone to ask you reset a password on a wesbite that is not familiar to you and you no has no other signs of security(ex: 2 factor authirization).

### Question 45: 
A search engine has a trend-tracking feature that provides information on how popular a search term is. The data can be filtered by geographic region, date, and category. Categories include arts and entertainment, computers and electronics, games, news, people and society, shopping, sports, and travel. Which of the following questions is LEAST likely to be answerable using the trends feature?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was B because I didn't see a specific label that said "politics" or "government based news", therefore I thought that there would
be no discussion about politics on the search engine. However, the most important fact was that no tag price was given based on the categories listed. 

### Question 48:
The figure below represents a network of physically linked devices, labeled A through H. A line between two devices indicates a connection. Devices can communicate only through the connections shown.
What is the minimum number of connections that would need to be removed from the network in order for device A to not be able to communicate with device F?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was B bc/ of the same reason as listed on *Question 41* where I believed that the question was how many connections would be needed between A and F in order for the
system to work. 

### Question 50:
Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was A bc/ I thought that a little loss of data might not greatly affect as to losing most or all of the data. However, now I know that the
correct answer is C as having a negtive images and colors being reversed wouldn't change the amount of information that the images consist. 


## Quiz 2 Corrections:

<img width="947" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165000633-196d8df3-e458-4a3d-b117-2da038837512.png">

### Question 1:
Which of the following best describes the ability of parallel computing solutions to improve efficiency?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was A bc/ I knew that sequential solving and parallel solving means that we break the amount of time it take for the sequencing solving into half to solve for parallel solving.

### Question 6:
A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation?

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was D because I had round-off errors and overflow errors mixed up. Round-off errors is where there aren't representation of real numbers in precise manner. While, over-flow error means that the greatest number represented is overcome with a sum that has a greater value.

### Question 8: 
Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using open-source software?

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was D bc/ open-source would mean that it is avaiable to the wider auidence, so it would be avaiable for the original developers. However, now I know that isn't true bc/ open-source would mean that the public can see and use the content but the work that was already posted cannot be edited by the creators of the program. Therefore,
the correct is C bc/ the answer explains what is granted to the audience with an open-source software.

### Question 9:
Which of the following best describes a challenge involved in using a parallel computing solution?

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was D bc/ a key word would need to be found with a specific order. However, the truth is that parallel computing couldn't work in cases where each step must be followed for how it is listed. Therefore,
the correct answer is A where parallel computing cannot work.

### Question 10:
A programmer is developing a word game. The programmer wants to create an algorithm that will take a list of words and return a list containing the first letter of all words that are palindromes (words that read the same backward or forward). The returned list should be in alphabetical order. For example, if the list contains the words Open bracket, open quotation, banana, close quotation, open quotation, kayak, close quotation, open quotation, mom, close quotation, open quotation, apple, close quotation, open quotation, level, close quotation, close bracket, the returned list would contain Open bracket, open quotation, k, close quotation, open quotation, l, close quotation, open quotation, m, close quotation, close bracket(because Open quotation, kayak, close quotation, Open quotation, level, close quotation, and Open quotation, mom, close quotationare palindromes).

The programmer knows that the following steps are necessary for the algorithm but is not sure in which order they should be executed.

Executing which of the following sequences of steps will enable the algorithm to work as intended?

I. First shorten, then keep palindromes, then sort

II. First keep palindromes, then shorten, then sort

III. First sort, then keep palindromes, then shorten

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was B bc/ I thought that the third option wouldn't work as I thought that "sort" might not work because the order would need to be
determined at the end of the program function. 

### Question 12:
Which of the following applications is most likely to benefit from the use of crowdsourcing?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was A bc/ I thought that there are different measurements in the world, which means that "crowdsourcing" might help for the conversions of the units. However,
the correct answer is D as because places and timezones don't align with the whole world therefore mulitple responses for landmarks is helpful by using "crowdsourcing".

### Question 13:
A computer has two processors that are able to run in parallel. The table below indicates the amount of time it takes either processor to execute four different processes. Assume that none of the processes is dependent on any of the other processes.
A program is used to assign processes to each of the processors. Which of the following describes how the program should assign the four processes to optimize execution time?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was B bc/ I thought that by subtracting the sums of each pair would make it reasonable for how long each pair of processors take to process. 
Though, the correct answer is C because the pairs of W and Z and X and Y take the shortest amount of time to process.

### Question 14:
A file storage application allows users to save their files on cloud servers. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first eight years of the application’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the following graphs. The line graph on the left shows the number of registered users each year. The line graph on the right shows the total amount of data stored by all users each year. The circle graph shows the distribution of file sizes currently stored by all users.
(note: 1 MB = 1,000 KB)

Which of the following best describes the average amount of data stored per user for the first eight years of the application’s existence?

- My Ans: C
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer is C bc/ the pi chart and how there is rough estimates of each MB and KB values and accordingly their percentages. However, I
didn't see the graphs and how they correspond with the pi chart, where there is a constancy with both the graphs.

### Question 19:
In the following procedure, assume that the parameter x is an integer.

<img width="679" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165003847-7a9eca82-579c-4eee-8b94-5bb27ecae518.png">

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was D bc/ I thought that the "if" statement would showcase a boolean function therefore there should be a true or false
result. However, I know that there is not "elif" or "else" statement for x values that are greater than 0, therefore when a x value greater than zero is entered the code doesn't execute.

### Question 24:
Which of the following best describes a direct benefit in using redundant routing on the Internet?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was B bc/ I thought that "redundancy" wouldn't mean the same thing as "fault-tolerance system". Now I know the anwer is C bc/ "redundancy" would
mean that the devices would have multiple possible ways to communicate within a network.

### Question 28:
Which of the following actions are generally helpful in program development?

i.Consulting potential users of the program to identify their concerns
ii.Writing and testing small code segments before adding them to the program
iii.Collaborating with other individuals when developing a large program

- My Ans: C
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was C bc/ I thought that programming development should only consist of the parts that include with planning, buliding, and reviewing part of the development. However,
I now know that D is correct bc/ it as important for potential users to help test the program bc/ of the feedback that the programmers get from a diverse audience.

### Question 30:
<img width="649" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165004402-20dec5c3-dccf-46c2-b218-027173eda959.png">

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was B bc/ I miscalculated when I was converting the RGB tripet to decimal values. Overall, I had made mistake for my division calculation.

### Question 31:
<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165005036-24835a8d-f022-4379-a243-657e43f98ed7.png">

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I didn't get enough time to think this question and therefore I had made an educated guess with fast calculations. I will make sure to go back and check my answers
for math realted questions. 

### Question 32:
A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was A bc/ I thought that with 5-bits there would be double the times of 4-bits, as the question went from 4 to 8. 8 is double of four, therefore
I thought that I would two times of the bits sequence. However, 4-bits is sufficent because of base 2 amount of info.

### Question 34:
<img width="637" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165005309-c4ae7483-ba75-4cbf-950c-067cada8ea78.png">

- My Ans: C
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer was C bc/ I thought that "OR" statements would serve better for the numebr of mystery books to be counted for at every possible way.

### Question 36:
A video-streaming Web site keeps count of the number of times each video has been played since it was first added to the site. The count is updated each time a video is played and is displayed next to each video to show its popularity.

At one time, the count for the most popular video was about two million. Sometime later, the same video displayed a seven-digit negative number as its count, while the counts for the other videos displayed correctly. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the error?

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was B bc/ I thought it might not be precise with the negative numbers to be represented. However, the precisiness of negative
numbers is correct and precise because it has exceeded with the greater value that is programmed.

### Question 40: 
A small team of wildlife researchers is working on a project that uses motion-activated field cameras to capture images of animals at study sites. The team is considering using a “citizen science” approach to analyze the images. Which of the following best explains why such an approach is considered useful for this project?

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was A bc/ of the indiviual perspectives on the research. However, I now know that the correct answer is D bc/ of the work efficiency is better
in a group.

- My Ans: C
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought the answer was C bc/ they include the requirements needed for the teacher to find students with one sport and gpa. However, I now know that the correct
answer is A as knowing the Student ID's is very important, because there might more than one of the same names who might play the same sport.

### Question 47:
<img width="665" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/165006050-cd1609f7-fd0d-4210-a4ab-0e0ce47a5349.png">

- My Ans: D
- Correct Ans: A
- Explanation of both answers: I thought that the answer is D bc/ most people who weren't interested in the application seem to have not read. However, that amount of people is less
compared to the number of people interested in the application and read more books as well as stay less on their phones.
