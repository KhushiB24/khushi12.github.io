## Quiz 5

### Question 2: <img width="896" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/167016416-2c39db68-f7aa-4cd8-a0d4-06209e67a3fb.png">

- My Answer: D
- Correct Answer: B
- Explanation: I chose D as the answer because I thought that the y-value needs to be more than compared to the x-value. Though, now I know that the correct answer is B because by adding an "ELSE" statement, this would ensure that there are two random calls, where depending on the number if it is eqaul to 1 ot greater than 1.

### Question 3: <img width="946" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/167041226-561af41d-b532-4f36-a739-f5e03e83eaad.png"> 

- My Answer: B and C
- Correct Answer: B and D
- Explanation: I thought that the answers are B and C bc/ when plugged in I was thinking about the count being greater than the x-value, instead of the y-value. Now I know that the correct answer is B and C bc/ how 1 is never less than -5.

### Question 4: <img width="950" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/167041411-ad765b4e-7cda-4007-a990-7e694f5ca5a6.png">

- My Answer: A and B
- Correct Answer: B and C
- Explanation: I chose A and B bc/ I thought that the minute hand would symbolize the smallest unit of bit. Reminder: Binary digits can only be represented as 0 or 1. Answer B is correct because the remainder comes in turn whether or not the remiander can be solved with the number bit, where 0 is for off and 1 is for on.

### Question 7: <img width="953" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/167042209-9cc59812-5e85-4622-9f1d-791add1a4a91.png">

- My Answer: A
- Correct Answer: C
- Explanation: I chose A bc/ I thought that the least number of bits would be required, where the number that is the least would work out eventually. Now I know that the correct answer is 7 bc/ 2^7= 128.

### Question 9: <img width="954" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89240973/167042416-acda4caa-c52b-459e-aaf5-1e445a5facb7.png">

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation: I chose A bc/ I thought that the computer system would take more time to follow tasks, where the amoutn of time exponentially rise. However, the answers A and D both contain patterns of exponential growth, where the most time taken for the ocmputer to perform its task would be for sorting data.

- My Ans: B
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation: I chose B bc/ I thought that the number of times of the results would be different order but have similiar values, from 0 to 10. However, now I know that the answer is C were the values are different however the amount of numbers are the same.

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: C
- Explanation: I chose A bc/ I thought that bits only matter in terms of being 2 times of the number that is given. Since the 32-bit would mean 2^32 and 64-bit would mean 2^64.

- My Ans: A
- Correct Ans: B
- Explanation: I chose A bc/ I thought that because the computer-controlled player is the cause of making the prgram to runner alot slower where I thought having two human players would be better. However, making approximate solutions would be good as there is a heuristic to solve this.

- My Ans: B and C
- Correct Ans: A and C
- Explanation: I chose B and C bc/ I thought that the order would matter for whether or not the results would be valid based on the prgram code. Though, now I see how option A is one of the correct answers bc/ there are still duplicates left after the program runns.

- My Ans: C
- Correct Ans: D
- Explanation: I chose C bc/ I thought about the answer being that subtracting an index by one would the inner loop. However, now I know that the outside loop should have the index code as then the values would be in check.
