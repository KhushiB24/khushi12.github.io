Notes
Drones: can be used in class demonstrations or can be used to find something that is way high up in a classroom
Dopamine & Video Games: with increased time with video games, depending on the situation, the people playing would neglect the basic needs for human survival (food, sleep, social skills, and hygiene)
Automated Telephones Trees: used for customer service, a procedural diagram that goes step by step of whether or not the input needs an automated response or human response. Procedural diagrams

### Github Pages Action Answers
Three of Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:

Insight on how the algorithm works
Increased creativity due to typing
Helps to solve hacking + virus related issues
Harmful Effects:
Would notice the business strategies and would need to solve any problems related to those
May have a decreased amount of writing on paper involved(impacts learning and memorization)
Would need to go to an organization or a greater authority if the mess-up happens from one's side.

Dopamine issues exist is real and does occur in my personal study and success in High School, where increased accessibility to unlimited data, newer phones, and an increase of entertainment during quarantine. 
This may lead to a habit of depending on technology for happiness, and in some circumstances avoiding any type of social interaction with loved ones. Due to virtual learning, the attention and concentration in now in-person class is harder because of the distraction that may have happened during home in virtual-learning. 
Therefore, it is harder to give focus to the class activities due to phone distraction and/or the habit of checking the phone during at home learning.

### Notes on Digital Divide
- Accessibility varies in regions of the country
- Government controlled + surveillance of technology(some countries)

### Factors:
- Financial condition, location, education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity
- Some places had conditions where a certain number of students didn't get education due to _DIGITAL DIVIDE_ 
- **EDUCATIONAL EQUITY**: options depending on individual's situation
- I think now there is a greater emphasis on creating technology made in protection for the technology education that has been build or that is building over the years. Yes, there are some chances where digital fears are creating digital divides where for example in rural places people might fear that they might encounter some issue that can't be resolved and therefore create more damage to the electronic device.

### Github Pages Action- Digital Empowerment

1. Someone empowers themselves in a digital world by asking search engines on how to start using technology for their purposes(school, work, or hobby-related). Another source would be to go to the library and ask the librarian/search for books that talk about technology and guides that help for first-time technology users.

2. Someone that is empowered can help someone that isn't empowered would be share their own experiences and give them certain tips for navigation as well as warnings. Something that I would do to help someone at DNHS would be to first ask them what they need help with and give them the warning signs ahead of time, so that they acknowledge what they need to know to be safe in the virtual environment.

3. The paper on the diagram provided is blocking digital empowerment. Yes, there are such barriers at Del Norte due to people who can't afford to have their own devices or the way the school Chromebook are(not good use for Computer Science classes). 
There is digital divide in elsewhere such people who don't have stable WiFi connections to power going out or poor signals due to bad weather.
