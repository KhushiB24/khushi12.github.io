## Data Representation

- Positional Numering System, with the power and base
- Each bits represents a different number of base of 2.
- Powers of 2 have all answers with even numbers, and where odd part of a binary number then the least signinficant bit is set to 1. 
-> If binary number ends in zero, the decimal value HAS TO BE even

- In a 8-bit binary numbers, there can be these many uniques values: 
   - 1 bit = 2 values
   - 2 bits = 4 values
   - 3 bits = 8 values
   
   Ans: 2 to the power of the number of bits is the number of unque values
