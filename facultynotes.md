## Dat_1 University Faculty Lecture

### Data Representation

- Positional Numbering System, with the power and base
- Each bits represents a different number of base of 2.
- Powers of 2 have all answers with even numbers, and where odd part of a binary number then the least significant bit is set to 1. 
-> If binary number ends in zero, the decimal value HAS TO BE even

- In a 8-bit binary numbers, there can be these many unique values: 
   - 1 bit = 2 values
   - 2 bits = 4 values
   - 3 bits = 8 values
   
   Ans: 2 to the power of the number of bits is the number of unique values

- Everything in computing is BITS!

### Steganography:
- we hide a message within a picture, where the number of bits must be changed
- 8-bit RGB image = more than 16 million colors
- With less bits there is more pixelated darker colors
- It is easy to manipulate pictures

# IOC-1 University Faculty Lecture
----
- Cloud computing makes computing more accessible than parallel/distributed computing
- Computer Science is the study of automated algorithmic in scale
- CS involves all aspects of courses
- Digital Divide is unintentional, however important to address
- Smartphone are a super-computers
- IBM Blue gene (fast computers) and a smartphone(as powerful and sometimes more powerful than IBM Blue genes)
- Smartphones don't give everything we desire in a computer, such as how the pandemic has changed what caused more people to want computers and issues with E-rate. 
- During the pandemic, the realization that access to internet is a human right
- Facial Recognition can be helpful though does violate basic human rights, such as consent of using picture as well as privacy invasion
- Algorithmic Justice League(art + research on AI)
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning helps the ecosystem and comes from huge parts of data

- Deep Learning is bad for the climate because of carbon emission and this has ethical concerns as well
- Depending on how use your internet, most companies have control over for social media companies to be removed
