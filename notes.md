## TPT 0.1 Written Response

### Notes on Benefits and Harmful Effect of Computing
- Drones: can be used in class demonstrations or can be used to find something that is way high up in a classroom
- Dopamine & Video Games: with increased time with video games, depending on the situation, the people playing would neglect the basic needs for human survival (food, sleep, social skills, and hygiene)
- Automated Telephones Trees: used for customer service, a procedural diagram that goes step by step of whether or not the input needs an automated response or human response. Procedural diagrams

### Github Pages Action Answers
- Three of Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:

1. Insight on how the algorithm works
2. Increased creativity due to typing
3. Helps to solve hacking + virus related issues
- Harmful Effects:
1. Would notice the business strategies and would need to solve any problems related to those
2. May have a decreased amount of writing on paper involved(impacts learning and memorization)
3. Would need to go to an organization or a greater authority if the mess-up happens from one's side.

- Dopamine issues exist is real and does occur in my personal study and success in High School, where increased accessibility to unlimited data, newer phones, and an increase of entertainment during quarantine. 
- This may lead to a habit of depending on technology for happiness, and in some circumstances avoiding any type of social interaction with loved ones. Due to virtual learning, the attention and concentration in now in-person class is harder because of the distraction that may have happened during home in virtual-learning. 
- Therefore, it is harder to give focus to the class activities due to phone distraction and/or the habit of checking the phone during at home learning.

### Notes on Digital Divide
- Accessibility varies in regions of the country
- Government controlled + surveillance of technology(some countries)

### Factors:
- Financial condition, location, education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity
- Some places had conditions where a certain number of students didn't get education due to _DIGITAL DIVIDE_ 
- **EDUCATIONAL EQUITY**: options depending on individual's situation
- I think now there is a greater emphasis on creating technology made in protection for the technology education that has been build or that is building over the years. Yes, there are some chances where digital fears are creating digital divides where for example in rural places people might fear that they might encounter some issue that can't be resolved and therefore create more damage to the electronic device.

### Github Pages Action- Digital Empowerment

1. Someone empowers themselves in a digital world by asking search engines on how to start using technology for their purposes(school, work, or hobby-related). Another source would be to go to the library and ask the librarian/search for books that talk about technology and guides that help for first-time technology users.

2. Someone that is empowered can help someone that isn't empowered would be share their own experiences and give them certain tips for navigation as well as warnings. Something that I would do to help someone at DNHS would be to first ask them what they need help with and give them the warning signs ahead of time, so that they acknowledge what they need to know to be safe in the virtual environment.

3. The paper on the diagram provided is blocking digital empowerment. Yes, there are such barriers at Del Norte due to people who can't afford to have their own devices or the way the school Chromebook are(not good use for Computer Science classes). 
There is digital divide in elsewhere such people who don't have stable WiFi connections to power going out or poor signals due to bad weather.

## Notes on Computing Bias

### Intentional or Purposeful Bias: 
- Two social media platforms, which is known to baised on age (note: Facebook is more used by older people) 
- Cases of voice decting error because of a different accent 
- Streaming services only streaming based on what the users are baised to see

### Github Pages Action 
1. The owner of the computer doesn't think this was intentional, because when programing there wasn't a given instructions for the camera to do a face recogniation for any person. Just as how some of the voice recongization doesn't occur due to an unique accent, the camera wasn't advanced program to dectect any given face.

2. I think this happened because the programmers of the computer didn't have a diverse sample, and didn't taught to do so as they may have assumed that any person would be dectected if they only a few samples of faces that the computer would recongize.

3. Yes, it is harmful due to the fact that there were assumptions made by the programmers to not include diversity as part of their camera project. I think it wasn't intented for the programmers to exclude certain faces from others for recongization, however the programmers did generalize. 

4. Yes, it should be corrected and updated at all times.

5. I would have a diverse groups of people that have an unique ethnic background to be evalauted and further code the program to allow any person, based on a given set values of rgb and facial features to recognize people.

## TPT 1.1

## Notes on Crowdsourcing
- more crowdsoucing = more connectivity and less computer bias due to diversity
- have sources to get info, send info, and be active in participation of distributed computing

### Evidence of Crowdsourcing
- Wikipedia has a self-policing community by reviews
- Crypto Currency and Block Chain are reviewed by other after indiviual miners do calculations, has helped the government to see currency in a new light, and block chains are associated with private data
- COVID Data initated extra caution and helped made decisions to protect oneself and community

### Obtain Data via Crowdsourcing
- RapidAPI where we learned about receiving and analyzing data 
- GitHub through forking, looking profiles and code history, Kaggle recommendation

### Github Pages Action
1. A crowdsource idea is that we would have a forum within the main cspnighthawkcodersociety page, where here we can receive extra help based on current assignments and the main points of each lesson that we learn highlighted, so if anyone misses a day they won't miss the main learning. I think how I can initiate this idea in our environment is that I can start with a smaller class, such as my own CSP class and encourage others to participate in the forum for guidance and coding strategies.

2. Del Norte crowdsourcing could work where there can be a common theme within CSP that can help the general population of the school, such as what to do if their Wifi in a computer goes out. Yes, my final project could be better with crowdsourcing because of more input and diverse ideas.

## Notes on the Legal and Ethical Concerns
- Cost of Free Code
- Money on Patents and Open Source is by the nature
- Create Commons Zero v1.0 Universal 
  - copyright interest and dedicates to world-wide public domain
- Open Source MIT License: code freely and to create closed source versions
- Open Source GPL License: deliver code in parts and is from away from GPL Creative Commons code where spliting the contrubiton code may be needed 

### Legal and Ethically
- Digital Rights Management software to protect, play, and/or distribute content
- When bypassing the systems and not having a subscription, this would mean that the user had downloaded and used the music or art content with the violation of the DRM, this means the action is illegal.
- Initial PUblic Offering(IPO)
- Creative Commons and Open Source 

### Github Pages Action
1. License types to the Tech Talk: Open Source License in GitHub and there are three platforms such as community and working edition.
2. We are still on the way to choose a license for the group project, we would most likely use the Creative Commons License. 

- Additional Notes:
  - open source license, where you can use the data and claim as your own
  - patents get the rights to something 

## Part 2

## Notes on Safe Computing
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- LinkedIn is a dichotomy, where we want to be known for our accomplishments

### PII Considerations
- Don't reveal important and confidential information about yourself such as Social Security Number, Tax Records, and other personal info to be concealed
- Grey items, be cautious such as Phone Number, Address, Name, Drivers License Number

### Beware, Establish practices for your own Safety
- Multi-factor authentication or biometrics
- Malware has attachments 
- Phising is someone who tries to mainpulate to the users to repsond to what they send

### Factors to Increase Security of System
- Multi Factor Authentication
- Biometrics= fingerprints or facial recognition
- Symmetric encryption: type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic info.
- Asymmetric cryptography(public-key cryptography): use a pair of related keys, one public key and and one private key, where to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect that from unauthorized access or use.

### Nefarious Uses of Internet
- Virus/Malware are anatonym of security
- Phising is to get virus into your device

### Github Pages Actions:
1. I have seen PII on my project where I had made about me page, which had my name. In first trimester, I had talked about my grade, my name, and what my parents do for work.
2. My feelings for PII and expose is that I understand why PII is used and for what reason. However there should be precaution with the personal info that we share online as there are bad people everywhere who would want to take advantage of our PII, by phising or hacking.
3. Good passwords are passwords that have mutliple characters, some numbers, and symbols. The safe length for a password would be 16-40, where I had a few college portals that have asked for a 40 character password. Bad passwords are passwords that are easy to guess and are veery short.
4. Symmetric Encryption is to get one key that key works for encryption and decryption. While, Assymetric Encryption is where there is one key for encryption and another key for decryption.
5. An example of encryption in deployment would be to use the IP freenom to make the IP address for the website public.
6. A phising scheme I have learned the hard way is to report the college websites that showcase that there is a message. Other techniques of phising would be through calls claiming something big to be fixed.








- Additional Notes:
  - safe computing = be aware of what info is getting sent
  - DNS and do google search to find your deployed site
  - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 
  - Pick a license for your repository( insgiht= change license) and pick a license for the team project  

## TT2 Notes:
- organize the topics 
- MVC 
- OOP = crud stuff, where the users used it
- Fibonacci, init(self) where self is a classes and the class talks about itself
  - Class is a template and defines the values
  - starting values for Fibonaaci is with the binary numbers
  - fibo_of is variable
- debugger call function
def __call__(self, n):
        if n < len(self.fiboSeq):
            return self.fiboSeq[n]
        else:
            # Compute the requested Fibonacci number
            fib_number = self(n - 1) + self(n - 2) # two recursive calls to self (__call__(self, n))
            self.fiboSeq.append(fib_number) # builds list, with most nested of the calculations 1st... may hurt your head
        return self.fiboSeq[n]
